                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>400ml coconut cream</li>
                    <li>20g fresh yeast, or fast-action dried yeast (7g)</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp caster sugar</li>
                    <li>500g rice flour</li>
                    <li>3 egg whites</li>
                    <li>Vegetable oil (for the pan)</li>
                    <li>(Optional) Eggs (to serve)</li>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <h1>Coconut Hopper Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>Stir the coconut cream, yeast, and sugar in a bowl and leave in a warm spot for 45 minutes or until risen and frothy.</p>

    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Sift the rice flour into the mixture and whisk until a smooth batter forms. Cover the bowl and leave in a warm place for 3-4 hours or until the batter has doubled in size â€“ the rising time will vary considerably depending on the room temperature (the warmer, the better). Just before cooking, lightly beat the egg whites with a fork until they are foamy, then stir into the hopper mixture with 1 tsp of salt.</p>

    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Heat a hopper pan or a small non-stick frying pan over a high heat, wipe the pan lightly with oil, then pour in a 60ml ladleful of the mixture. Swirl to coat the sides of the pan, leaving a small pool of mixture in the center. Crack in an egg (if using), then cover the pan with a lid and steam the hopper for 2-3 minutes or until the center is firm and the sides are golden and crisp. Keep the cooked hoppers warm and repeat the process until all the batter has been used.</p>
